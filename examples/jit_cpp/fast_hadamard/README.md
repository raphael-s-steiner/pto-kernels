## Fast Hadamard

### Layout

- `standard/`: plain Hadamard kernel, benchmark, plot, and test files
- `cube/`: cube-unit (matmul) Hadamard kernel, benchmark, plot, and test files
- `fuse_int8_quant/`: int8 quantize and fused Hadamard+int8 quant files
- `fuse_int4_quant/`: int4 quantize and fused Hadamard+int4 quant files
- shared helpers stay at the top level:
  - `bench_common.py`
  - `plot_common.py`
  - `jit_util_common.py`
  - `conftest.py`

### Output

Benchmark scripts save CSV files into the subdirectories that own the real
implementations:

- `standard/outputs/csv/fht_pto_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target standard`
- `cube/outputs/csv/fht_cube_compare_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target cube`
- `fuse_int8_quant/outputs/csv/quantize_compare_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target quantize_int8`
- `fuse_int8_quant/outputs/csv/fht_quant_compare_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target hadamard_quant_int8`
- `fuse_int4_quant/outputs/csv/quantize_compare_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target quantize_int4`
- `fuse_int4_quant/outputs/csv/fht_quant_compare_bd*.csv` from `benchmark.py --target hadamard_quant_int4`

Plot scripts read CSV files from the same subdirectories and save figures to:

- `standard/outputs/plots/`
- `cube/outputs/plots/`
- `fuse_int8_quant/outputs/plots/`
- `fuse_int4_quant/outputs/plots/`
- `outputs/plots/` for the top-level int8-vs-int4 comparison plot targets

JIT-compiled shared libraries are saved to:

- `standard/outputs/so/`
- `cube/outputs/so/`
- `fuse_int8_quant/outputs/so/`
- `fuse_int4_quant/outputs/so/`

In `benchmark.py --target hadamard_quant_int8`, the unfused reference is
`hadamard_torch_stagewise(...) + torch_npu.npu_quantize(...)`, reported as
`torch_unfused_*` in the CSV and plots.

In the int4 targets, outputs use packed-byte storage with shape `[batch, N // 2]`.
The unfused int4 reference path is `hadamard_torch_stagewise(...)` followed by a
torch packed-int4 reference, also reported as `torch_unfused_*` in the fused CSV.

In `benchmark.py --target cube`, the cube kernel applies the balanced
Kronecker split `H_n = H_R (x) H_C` as `Y = H_R * X * H_C`, i.e. two matmuls
on the cube unit per tile of samples instead of `log2(N)` vector butterfly
stages. It is out-of-place (`fn(x, y)`) and supports `N` in `[256, 16384]`,
so its hidden-dimension grid starts at 256 instead of 128. The same shapes
are also timed with the `standard/` vector kernel, reported as `vector_*` in
the CSV and plots alongside the `cube_speedup_vs_vector` column.

The cube arm launches with the wrapper's per-shape `block_dim` schedule, so the
`bd` in the CSV filename is the cap (`cube_core_num`) and the `cube_block_dim`
column records what each shape actually ran at.

Both arms resolve the stream per call: `torch.npu.current_stream()` drains the
torch_npu async task queue, which is what orders a raw ctypes launch after the
torch ops that fill its inputs. That drain costs ~27 us per call, more than the
device time of every shape in the grid, so these CSV durations are launch-bound
for both kernels and the `cube_speedup_vs_vector` column mostly compares
wrapper overhead. Hoisting the stream pointer out of the loop does not fix
this -- it drops the drain, and the kernel can then run ahead of the torch ops
setting up its inputs and of the events meant to bracket it.

Device time needs a profiler. `cube/devtime_bench.py` runs a list of shapes
under `msprof` and reads the per-launch duration off the device task record:

```bash
cat > /tmp/cfg.json <<'EOF'
[{"tag":"cube","kind":"cube","batch":8192,"n":4096,"bd":24,"reps":10,"warmup":3},
 {"tag":"std", "kind":"std", "batch":8192,"n":4096,"bd":24,"reps":10,"warmup":3}]
EOF
python cube/devtime_bench.py /tmp/cfg.json
```

### Measured device time

msprof `op_summary`, median of 20 launches over 3 interleaved passes, 910B2,
with the shipped `block_dim` schedule. The ratio is `vector_us / cube_us`, so
**above 1.0 means the cube kernel is faster** and below 1.0 means the vector
kernel in `standard/` wins. The `cube_speedup_vs_vector` column in the CSV uses
the same convention.

| batch | N=256 | N=1024 | N=4096 |
|------:|------:|-------:|-------:|
|    64 | 1.26x | 1.64x  | 1.67x  |
|   256 | 0.87x | 1.43x  | 1.79x  |
|  1024 | 0.66x | 1.49x  | 2.01x  |
|  4096 | 0.72x | 1.61x  | 2.08x  |
|  8192 | 0.84x | 1.64x  | 2.09x  |
| 65536 | 1.95x | 1.48x  | 1.74x  |

At batch 8192 that is 15.1 / 26.7 / 94.7 us for the cube kernel against
12.7 / 43.9 / 198.3 us for the vector one; peak is 1614 GB/s at N=256
batch 65536. Geometric mean over the 18 shapes above is 1.42x.

`N=256` is the weak case, and `batch` 256 to 8192 is where it loses. The
balanced split makes both Hadamard factors 16x16, so a tile is only 32 samples
and a given batch yields the fewest tiles of any size -- which turned out to be
exactly the problem. See **Why N=256 is the weak case** below. The alternative
for small `N` is a single dense `Y = X * H_N` product, which trades 8x the FLOPs
for far fewer descriptors; it is not implemented here because it is no longer
the two-sided split this kernel is about.

### Why N=256 is the weak case

The cube kernel's *slope* is the better one at every size: fitted across batch
at N=256 it is 0.629 ns/sample against the vector kernel's 1.196, i.e. 1.90x
leaner. What it carried was a ~13 us intercept. Four candidate causes were
measured and all four refuted -- block dispatch is 0.90 us at `block_dim=24`,
the per-core Hadamard-factor prologue is free (0.90 us, identical to an empty
kernel), deleting both `TMATMUL`s saves 2-13% (`PTO_HAD_NOMM`), and reps=20 and
reps=2000 give identical times, so it is not a clock ramp either.

It is **pipeline depth per core**, and two sweeps isolate it. Holding the work
fixed at 48 tiles and changing only the spread:

| cores | 2 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 24 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| us | 13.15 | 9.06 | **8.68** | 10.12 | 16.26 |

8 cores beat 24 on identical work by 1.87x. Pinning tiles-per-core at 2 and
varying the core count gives `t = 1.99 us + 0.679 us * cores` -- wall time grows
*linearly* with core count although every core does identical independent work,
and the aggregate rate stays at 94 GB/s whether 1 core or 24 are running.
Pinning the core count at 4 and varying the run length gives
`t = 4.01 us + 0.365 us * tiles_per_core`, i.e. 359 GB/s. Both fit every
measured point to within 0.03 us. A tile costs **340 ns on a shallow core and
91 ns on a deep one**. Depth buys bandwidth; width does not.

Since every tile is the same 16 KB at every size (`S * N = 8192` throughout the
case table), the tile count scales with `batch * N`, so N=256 is simply the size
that runs out of tiles first -- at batch 1024 it has 32 tiles against 128 for
N=1024 and 512 for N=4096, which at `block_dim=24` is 2 tiles per core, the
worst possible depth.

Two fixes follow, and they are both in the shipped kernel:

- **`PTO_HAD_DBUF`** splits the C==16 tile body at its L1 turnaround into two
  phases and issues `A(i+1)` before `B(i)`. The straight-line body walks
  MTE1 -> M -> FIX -> MTE1 -> M -> FIX, and because each pipe is in-order its
  *second* MTE1 use cannot start until its own first matmul and L0C->L1 move
  retire -- which also pins the next tile's first MTE1 behind it, so only the
  GM->L1 load ever overlapped. Interleaving makes the MTE1 order
  `A0 A1 B0 A2 B1 ...`. Needs two of every intermediate plus a 4-deep X ring.
- **A `block_dim` schedule** in the wrapper instead of the constant 24:
  `bd = clamp(round(sqrt(k * tiles)), 1, 24)`, with `k` fitted per `N` over the
  whole case table -- 40 measured shapes, no extrapolation. It lands within
  1.025x of the best measured `block_dim` (mean 1.001x). The last column is what
  the constant 24 cost at that size, i.e. what the schedule buys:

  |     N |     k | shapes | worst regret | constant-24 worst |
  |------:|------:|-------:|-------------:|------------------:|
  |   256 |  0.49 |      6 |       1.025x |            1.834x |
  |   512 |  1.00 |      6 |       1.005x |            1.908x |
  |  1024 |  8.00 |      6 |       1.000x |            1.207x |
  |  2048 | 16.00 |      6 |       1.000x |            1.085x |
  |  4096 |  8.00 |      6 |       1.000x |            1.093x |
  |  8192 |  8.00 |      5 |       1.000x |            1.000x |
  | 16384 |  8.00 |      5 |       1.000x |            1.000x |

  `k` is fitted per `N` rather than from a rule because nothing about `N`
  predicts it: **N=512 wants `k = 1` where N=1024 wants 8**, and an earlier
  version of this schedule assumed 8 for it and was 1.51x off at batch 1024.
  N=512 is the only size whose tile is 16 `TEXTRACT`s plus 16 `TSTORE`s -- the
  most per-tile work in the table -- which is the likely reason, but it was found
  by sweeping every size, not by that argument. If the case table gains a size,
  sweep `block_dim` for it and add the entry rather than trusting the default.

Measured as a 2x2 factorial at N=256, device time in us (`sched` = scheduled
`block_dim`, `dbuf` = the two-phase tile):

| batch | neither | sched only | dbuf only | both | vs vector, both |
|------:|--------:|-----------:|----------:|-----:|----------------:|
|    64 |    2.84 |       2.84 |      2.90 | 2.52 | 1.26x |
|   256 |    6.38 |       3.99 |      6.41 | 3.66 | 0.87x |
|  1024 |   11.58 |       7.25 |     11.26 | 6.14 | 0.66x |
|  4096 |   16.89 |      12.88 |     16.06 |10.86 | 0.72x |
|  8192 |   20.28 |      17.83 |     18.68 |14.66 | 0.84x |
| 65536 |   53.93 |      53.93 |     41.28 |41.28 | 1.95x |

The two are complementary rather than redundant -- the schedule pays at small
batch, the deep pipeline at large batch -- and superadditive where they meet
(at batch 1024, 1.60x and 1.03x alone, 1.89x together), because the deep
pipeline only has something to overlap once a core has a run of tiles to give
it. Together, measured against the kernel as it stood before both changes (built
from git HEAD, not from the `PTO_HAD_DBUF=0` switch) over all 7 sizes x 5
batches: **1.00x to 1.96x, geometric mean 1.12x, no regression**. The largest
single wins are N=256 batch 1024 (1.96x) and N=512 batch 256 (1.91x).

A caution on reading that table: at the largest shapes this harness cannot
resolve differences below about 10%. A null control -- the same `.so` under two
names, same `block_dim` -- measured 208.08 vs 228.28 us at N=8192 batch 8192,
a 0.91x "regression" from zero code difference, and the sign of that shape's
difference flips between runs. The spread within one pass is tight (<1%), so it
is a per-run, per-library offset rather than jitter; tensor placement is the
likely cause. Anything inside that band at `block_dim=24` and `N > 256`, where
both builds compile the same shallow path, is noise -- the shallow buffer
offsets are mechanically identical and the shallow event ids unchanged.

Both are gated: build with `-DPTO_HAD_DBUF=0` for the single-buffered control,
and pass `block_dim=` to override the schedule. `cube/build_variant.sh` builds
one switch combination and `cube/validate_variant.py` checks a prebuilt variant
against an exact fp64 reference -- run it before timing anything, since a switch
that computes the wrong answer is a broken lever, not a slow technique. `block_dim` must not change
results, and `test_block_dim_does_not_change_result` asserts bit-identical
output across eight values of it.

One caution learned here: the deep path needed extra `set_flag`/`wait_flag`
event ids, and renumbering the *existing* ids -- in a path that was otherwise
untouched -- cost a reproducible 0.92x at N=1024 batch 65536. The two drivers
now keep separate id names over a shared pool so the shallow path's flags are
exactly what they were. Measure renumbering as its own change.

The cube path is also the more accurate of the two: it accumulates in fp32 and
rounds to fp16 twice instead of `log2(N)` times, which measures a relative RMS
error of 2.9e-4 against an exact fp64 reference, versus 6.3e-4 to 8.4e-4 for
the vector kernel.
